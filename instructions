Hi,

Thanks for your time today and a very interesting chat.

As discussed, the home task was designed for up to half a day as follows:
Target: build a single page app that enables to search a video within a YouTube playlist and watch it with a video YouTube player
API: YouTube data API (V3)
Technology Stack: React, JavaScript and Node.js
Playlists: Salesfoce's HowTos - see link
Video player: embed the YouTube player
Bonus point: Show the YouTube transcript next to the video (see how to open the transcript here)

Please let me know if you have any questions and when we can set up a follow up call with Michael and I.

Thanks
